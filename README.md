Introduction:

EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY:

Early in development this project is not complete !

This is my project to create a virus written in only python that will completely destroy you(theoretically) any help/suggestions is appreciated.
I already know my code is formatted teribbly, i am working on it and also i am trying to make my script very noob friendly. I will also have a obfuscated live exe for you too test on a virtual machine or to try and deobfuscate goodluck with that.

------------------
Features:
1) My script uses Zero third-party modules, only built in python modules.
2) This script instantly disables detection by excluding c: drive.
3) Opens ports for ssh, reverse shell etc.
4) Installs and configures ssh-server on the target machine.
5) Creates a new user on the system for ssh.
6) Tries a reverse shell connection.
7) Moves exe to temp folder, creates a ps1 reverse shell script in the tempfolder and adds it taskscheduler.
8) Hides the malware directory.
9) Then deletes the exe from the system relying on the reverse shell startup script for persistence
10) Undetected by only windows-defender when reverse shell is removed i need to find another way, like make a python rat.
11) USB Dropper has been implemented.
-----------------
Features i want to implement:
1) Everybrand of Anti-virus needs to be bypassed.
2) C2 Server connection.
3) Sensitive file enumeration and exfiltration.
4) Dll injection.
5) Crypto-mining functionalities if requested.
6) A linux version.
7) Virtual machine detection
-----------------
|Making it a windows excecutable|
1) To make an exe you must use auto-py-to-exe https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
2) On auto-py-to-exe you must enable the option under > Advanced > uac-admin this will correctly obtain administrator privilages.
